									<h2>Trajectory Forecasting of Unknown Dynamical Systems</h2>
									<p>The github repository is : <a href="https://github.com/ah19190/moving-obstacle-trajectory-prediction">https://github.com/ah19190/moving-obstacle-trajectory-prediction</a> and the report can be found <a href="/PDFs/Moving_object_trajectory_prediction.pdf">here</a>.</p>

									<p>For autonomous robots or vehicles, safety and performance are critical factors for motion planning – which can be
										loosely defined as how robots decide what motions to perform in order to safely travel from point A to B. The problem of two-dimensional motion 
										planning with an arbitrary number of obstacles moving with bounded velocity is NP-hard (7). There are practical solutions that are effective when the robot and
										environmental factors are exactly known, but in real-world settings where those assumptions are no longer valid,
										safety is not guaranteed. 
									</p>

									<p>When environments are dynamic and not known in advance, the robot would need to reason about uncertainty. 
										This project forms part of the predictive approach. In the predictive approach, there are two steps:
										<li>Forecasting the dynamic object future motion</li>
										<li>Incorporating it into a MPC scheme that implements an optimal avoidance strategy.</li>
									</p>
									
									
									<p>This project will focus on implementing a new approach to the first step, and evaluating its performance. The
										main idea of the project is to use an extension of the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm first developed in discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical
										systems developed <a href="//doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1509.03580">here</a>. 
									</p>

									<p>The code forecasts the trajectory of a dynamic moving obstacle without any pre-existing knowledge of the
										obstacle and its path. To my knowledge, prior to this project, there have been no existing solutions that utilise SINDy or an extension of
										SINDy to predict trajectories based on high fidelity simulation data (such as those generated by GAZEBO). 
									</p>

									<p>I use the PySINDy package that implements different extensions of SINDy available <a href="//github.com/dynamicslab/pysindy">here</a>.
									</p>

									<p>The contributions of this code will be to:
										<li>Apply the weak formulation of SINDy to predict the future motion of unknown objects modelled using a high
										fidelity trajectory simulator Gazebo, and evaluate its performance.
										</li>
										<li>Improve accuracy and robustness to sudden changes in motion by implementing an elastic moving window
										that specifies how much of the trajectory data is relevant for fitting.
										</li>

									<h2>Merging packets using Kernel-Bypass Frameworks</h2>
										<p>This is the link to the report we submitted for this <a href="/PDFs/Group_Project_Report.pdf">project</a>.</p>

										<h3>Background</h3>
										<p>Caching systems store responses to frequently-made requests from users within main memory.
											This reduces expensive resource usage (e.g. backend databases), which lowers latency. Many popular
											web applications, such as Facebook and Wikipedia, use Memcached, a key-value store-based caching
											system termed “the gold standard of web caching”.</p>
											
											<p>Despite its popularity, Memcached suffers from well-documented performance limitation: 
												<b>Memcached spends 70% of the time in the Linux kernel processing packets</b>. 
											</p>

												<img src="images/problemOne.png"

												<figcaption>Fig.1 - Multiple clients sending requests to Memcached server. Memcached has to process them one by one. If each requests take t time, n requests take nt amount of time to fulfil. </figcaption>
											  </span>

											<p>This means that when multiple clients send requests to Memcached, the time spent processing packets will add up. 
												This makes it ripe for optimization through packet aggregation. However, if request aggregation involves the kernel 
												when processing packets, this overhead is not absorbed, only transferred. Kernel-bypassing frameworks, such as 
												the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), overcome this by manipulating packets entirely within userspace. </p>
												
												<p>Yet, modifying existing applications to use these frameworks may be costly, as the application must now 
													implement and attain high performance on a dedicated network stack.
												</p>

												<img src="images/problemTwo.png" alt="Problem solution - middlebox" id="project-image"/>
												<figcaption>Fig.2 - Multiple clients send requests to Memcached server. Middlebox intercepts requests and aggregates them, sending only 1 request to Memcached. So Memcached only spends t time processing requests. </figcaption>
											</span>
						
										<p>  We therefore implement a software middlebox on top of DPDK, which
											absorbs the packet-processing overhead without requiring the modification of deployed applications. 
											<b>This reduces the kernel cost per request.</b>
