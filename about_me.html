									<h2>Education</h2>

									<h3>MSc Computing - Imperial College London</h3>
									<h4>October 2022 - September 2023</h4>

									<p>I am currently working on my MSc individual project provisionally titled "Unknown Object Trajectory Prediction using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics". The goal of the project is to implement a model in Python that identifies the governing equation of a dynamically moving object, and using that to predict the future trajectory of the object.  </p>
									<p>Previously, I completed an MSc group project titled "Merging packets using Kernel-Bypass Frameworks" implemented in C. We achieved a distinction in our project for our novel implementation of a software middlebox that can aggregate packets without involving the kernel, reducing system calls and improving the performance of caching systems such as Memcached. Read more about it <a href="/PDFs/Group_Project_Report.pdf">here</a> or see our <a href="https://github.com/ajonw/group-project">GitHub page</a>.</p>
									<p>I am comfortable working in C++, Java and Python, with experience completing coursework and projects in these languages.</p>

									<h3>BSc Mathematics, Statistics and Financial Economics - Queen Mary University of London</h3>
									<h4>September 2019 - July 2022</h4>

									<p>Previously, I completed my bachelors at Queen Mary with First Class Honours and a module average of 84%. </p>

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<h3>Front Office Summer Intern - NatWest Markets Plc</h3>
									<h4>June 2021 - September 2021</h4>

									<p>Front Office Summer Internship in the Sales & Trading division of the investment bank. As part of my internship, I rotated around different desks and shadowed people on the team. At each desk, I concluded my shadowing by presenting/completing tasks set out by each team detailed below.  </p>
