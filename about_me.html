									<h2>Education</h2>

									<h3>MSc Computing - Imperial College London</h3>
									<h4>October 2022 - September 2023</h4>

									<p>I am currently working on my MSc individual project provisionally titled "Unknown Object Trajectory Prediction using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics". The goal of the project is to implement a model in Python that identifies the governing equation of a dynamically moving object, and using that to predict the future trajectory of the object.  </p>
									<p>Previously, I completed an MSc group project titled "Merging packets using Kernel-Bypass Frameworks" implemented in C. We achieved a distinction in our project for our novel implementation of a software middlebox that can aggregate packets without involving the kernel, reducing system calls and improving the performance of caching systems such as Memcached. Read more about it <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
									<p>I am comfortable working in C++, Java and Python, with experience completing coursework and projects in these languages.</p>

									<h3>BSc Mathematics, Statistics and Financial Economics - Queen Mary University of London</h3>
									<h4>September 2019 - July 2022</h4>

									<p>I completed my bachelors at Queen Mary with First Class Honours and a module average of 84%. Some of the modules I took are Financial Mathematics, Time series, Corporate Finance, Mathematical Tools for Asset Management.</p>
									<p>During my time as a student, I held committee positions in the Queen Mary Banking and Finance Society and Erasmus Student Network. I was also a buddy scheme mentor where I guided first year students through their first year of university, ensuring they had a smooth transition to university. </p>

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<h3>Front Office Summer Intern - NatWest Markets Plc</h3>
									<h4>June 2021 - September 2021</h4>

									<p>Front Office Summer Internship in the Sales & Trading division of the investment bank. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience by rotating across various desks and closely shadowing professionals in the field. This comprehensive exposure provided me with a multifaceted understanding of the Sales & Trading operations within the investment bank.</p>
									<h5>Capstone presentation</h5>
									<p>One of the highlights of my internship was the capstone presentation, I analysed China’s long-term “common prosperity” policy. In removing numerical GDP growth targets, China introduced downside risks for short-term GDP growth; this led to predictions of limited rate hikes or currency appreciation measures between 2021 and 2022. Using my research, I proposed a forward-forward swap on EURCNH that could be pitched to clients that would hedge short term downside risk while being bullish on the longer term strength of the yuan.</p>
									
									<h5>FX Forwards Trading:</h5> 
									<p>During my time with the desk, I worked on modelling potential scenarios of Federal Reserve tapering on quantitative easing measures. This involved analyzing the impact of various factors on the market and developing quantitative models to assess potential outcomes. This experience enhanced my understanding of market dynamics and the intricacies of trading in foreign exchange.</p>
									<h5>Private Placement:</h5> 
									<p>I conducted a comprehensive assessment of an airport group's suitability for Private Placement and presented my findings. This task allowed me to delve into the intricacies of investment evaluation and develop a deeper understanding of the considerations involved in private placements.</p>
									<h5>Capital Management Unit:</h5>
									<p>I undertook in-depth analyses of various desks, identifying opportunities to reduce Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs). This involved evaluating existing portfolios, identifying areas of improvement, and suggesting strategies to optimize capital allocation. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into risk management and capital efficiency within a financial institution.</p>
									<h5>Portfolio Risk Management:</h5>
									<p>I worked on building a financial model totalling expected monthly repayment of commercial loans, taking into account delinquency and default on loans</p>
									
									<h3>Student Consultant - Queen Mary University of London</h3>
									<h4>February 2020 - April 2020</h4>

									<p>Consultancy project at Queen Mary supported by JP Morgan, where students get the opportunity to work with an East London Business client.
										I worked with a few other students for a London based startup who was seeking to establish an escape room business model for corporate clients. 
										We conducted a survey of competitor offerings across London and designed an initial product offering for our client. Despite a lack of market data, 
										we successfully completed the project for our client. 
									</p>

									<h3>Brand Ambassador - DFS Group Limited</h3>
									<h4>April 2019 - August 2019</h4>

									<p>I worked at Changi Airport in the Duty Free Shop as a Brand Ambassador for spirit brands under LVMH. I served customers by explaining the different offerings and promotions that were available in the store. 
										Since the customers were international and came from different backgrounds, I tailored my recommendations based on their duty-free allowance and preference. </p>

									<h4>May 2023 - Present</h4>

									<h5>Treasurer and Marketing Officer </h5>
									<p>For the academic year of 2021-22, I was elected Treasurer of the society and took up the responsibility of Marketing Officer. 
										I was responsible for carefully budgeting expenses and procuring items for our events. As marketing officer, I managed our social media platforms. I led workshops that equipped members with knowledge about the finance industry, 
									and moderated panels with industry speakers. </p>

									<h5>Head of Ambassadors and Social Media Officer </h5>
									<p>For the academic year of 2020-21, I led QMBFS's Ambassador Programme and created content for our social media. 
										I led the training for the society's ambassadors to help them prepare for a career in the finance industry by holding CV workshops, 
										psychometric assessment preparation and mock case studies. In addition to that, I introduced a mentoring scheme where each ambassador were mentored
										by a current committee member. </p>
									<p>In my role as social media officer, I picked up Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create marketing material for promoting the society and the events that we held.
