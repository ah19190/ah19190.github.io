									<h3>MSc Computing - Imperial College London</h3>
									<h4>October 2022 - September 2023</h4>

									<p>I am currently working on my MSc individual project provisionally titled "Unknown Object Trajectory Prediction using Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics". The goal of the project is to implement a model in Python that identifies the governing equation of a dynamically moving object, and using that to predict the future trajectory of the object.  </p>
									<p>Previously, I completed an MSc group project titled "Merging packets using Kernel-Bypass Frameworks" implemented in C. We achieved a distinction in our project for our novel implementation of a software middlebox that can aggregate packets without involving the kernel, reducing system calls and improving the performance of caching systems such as Memcached. Read more about it <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
